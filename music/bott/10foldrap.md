# Periodic Table of Topological Insulators & Superconductors: Nerdcore Rap Prompts for SORA2

Here are 10 nerdcore rap song prompts, each matching the vibe of a different symmetry class from the tenfold way. Each prompt is designed to visualize the mathematical structure, physical meaning, and aesthetic of its class.

---

## 1. **Class A: The Anomalous Flow**
**Vibe:** Pure, unconstrained quantum complexity. No time, no charge, just raw geometry.
**Visual Prompt:**
*An ethereal, non-orientable 4D lattice made of glowing light pipes floats in a void. A single MC, dressed in robes of shifting complex phase angles (e.g., θ from 0 to 2π), raps while riding a wavefunction that twists like a Möbius strip. The camera follows the Chern number—a pulsing golden integer—as it counts the twists in the manifold. In 2D, the scene is a quantum Hall plateau with spectral flow edge states buzzing like neon highways.*

**Hook:** *"No symmetry to hold me, just the Berry phase that molds me / My invariant's an integer, a story yet untold, see? / Crossing Brillouin zones, leaving geometric scars / The Chern number in my hands, connecting distant stars."*

---

## 2. **Class AIII: The Chiral Chain**
**Vibe:** Sublattice symmetry. Everything is paired, mirrored, yet fundamentally skewed.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 1D bipartite chain (like the SSH model) stretches to infinity, with two distinct atom types glowing red and blue. The MC is split into two identical, ghostly avatars—one on each sublattice—rapping in perfect antiphase. When the topological invariant is **Z**, the chain's dimerization pattern creates a soliton at the center, where a localized zero-mode beats like a heart. The "winding number" is visualized as a spectral helix twisting around the MC.*

**Hook:** *"Sublattice symmetry, a chiral decree / My winding number counts what your eyes can't see. Red site, blue site, in a quantum ballet / A zero mode trapped where the edges give way."*

---

## 3. **Class AI: The Time-Keeper's Monologue**
**Vibe:** Time-reversal with T²=+1. Stable, classical, but trivial in low dimensions. The "real" deal.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A stark, crystalline 3D lattice where every atom is a perfect, mirrored copy of itself across time. The MC, dressed in a lab coat with clocks for buttons, raps in a cleanroom. His words appear as real-number equations that don't flutter. The scene is orderly, but as he rhymes about dimension 4, the **2Z** invariant manifests as pairs of robust edge modes materializing, linking like-forbidden bands.*

**Hook:** *"Time squared is plus one, keep the complex numbers tame / My Hamiltonian's real, it's a symmetric frame. But in the fourth dimension, watch the pattern shift / An even integer invariant, a quantum gift."*

---

## 4. **Class BDI: The Majorana Mirror**
**Vibe:** The "perfect" symmetry: Time, Charge, Chiral all with +1 squares. Integer invariant in 1D.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 1D Kitaev chain in its topological phase. The MC is his own antiparticle—a Majorana fermion—rapped as a split persona: one half at each end of the wire. The **Z** invariant is shown as the number of Majorana zero modes, visualized as spinning, ethereal gears at the chain's ends. The scene has a deep, mirrored symmetry; every particle has a hole-partner.*

**Hook:** *"T and C both plus one, I'm a self-conjugate state / A Majorana bound to the quantum fate. Count the zero modes, an integer score / At the edge of the wire, I am nothing more."*

---

## 5. **Class D: The Superconducting Solitude**
**Vibe:** Particle-hole symmetry only. Cold, isolated, binary. The realm of p-wave superconductors.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 2D p+ip superconductor's vortex lattice in a dark, cryogenic landscape. The MC, a lone quasiparticle, raps from inside a swirling quantum vortex. The topological invariant is a **Z** number in 2D, shown as the number of chiral Majorana edge modes circulating the sample like a spectral river. In 1D, it's the binary **Z₂**: a single, glowing Majorana zero mode either exists or doesn't—a lightswitch flipping.*

**Hook:** *"No time reversal here, in this frozen state / Just particle-hole, sealing my fate. **Z** in two-D, a chiral stream / **Z₂** in the wire, a binary dream."*

---

## 6. **Class DIII: The Helical Highway**
**Vibe:** Time-reversal with T²=-1, plus chiral. Spins are locked to momentum. The Kane-Mele / topological insulator vibe.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 2D quantum spin Hall sample. The MC raps while surfing on the edge state—but his "flow" splits into two opposite directions, locked to his spin (up goes left, down goes right, visualized as colors). The **Z₂** invariant is shown as the impossibility of untangling these helical paths without breaking symmetry. The scene has a sleek, futuristic, "protected" feel.*

**Hook:** *"Time reversal squared gives a minus sign / Spin-momentum locking, this edge is mine. A **Z₂** invariant, a robust pair / Backscatter forbidden, I'm flowing free as air."*

---

## 7. **Class AII: The Topological Insulator Anthem**
**Vibe:** Time-reversal with T²=-1 (spin-orbit coupling). The classic 2D & 3D topological insulator (like Bi₂Se₃).
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 3D crystal of bismuth selenide, transparent with a glowing, metallic surface. The MC stands on the conducting surface state, rapping while the insulating bulk pulses dimly below. The **Z₂** invariant is visualized as a Möbius strip formed by the wavefunction's spin texture over the Brillouin zone. In 2D, it's the quantum spin Hall effect from Class DIII, but the focus is on the bulk-boundary correspondence.*

**Hook:** *"Kramers' doublets, no band can be alone / The bulk is dark, but the surface has grown. A **Z₂** number, a twist in the phase / Metallic edges in a quantum haze."*

---

## 8. **Class CII: The Spinful Symphony**
**Vibe:** Time and Charge both with squares of -1. Chiral present. Related to spin-1/2 systems with SU(2) symmetry.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A intricate, woven fabric representing a system with spin-SU(2) symmetry. The MC is a quartet, rapping in harmony—representing the doubled degrees of freedom. The invariant in 2D is **Z₂**, but in 0D it's **2Z** (even integers). Visualize pairs of edge states emerging and annihilating in a precise, symmetric dance. The aesthetic is mathematical and ornate, like a quantum tapestry.*

**Hook:** *"T and C both minus, a spinful constraint / My invariant's even, no anomaly is tainted. Chiral symmetry weaving a protected thread / In this symmetry class, what the Bott clock said."*

---

## 9. **Class C: The Superconducting Skyrmion**
**Vibe:** Particle-hole with C²=-1. Associated with spin-singlet superconductors (like d-wave). Even integer invariants.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 2D landscape of a d-wave superconductor with dₓ²-y² symmetry. The gap function has four nodal points. The MC's flow mimics the changing phase of the order parameter. The **2Z** invariant is visualized as skyrmions in the spin texture—even-numbered, stable topological defects swirling in the background. The feel is grand and paired, like a choir of Cooper pairs.*

**Hook:** *"Charge squared is minus one, in a singlet state / Cooper pairs dancing, sealing their fate. An even Chern number, **2Z** is the name / In the skyrmion texture, we play the game."*

---

## 10. **Class CI: The Time-Reversed Superconductor**
**Vibe:** Time-reversal +1, particle-hole -1. Chiral present. A "balanced" superconductor with protected nodes.
**Visual Prompt:**
*A 3D system where gapless, topological superconducting nodes (Weyl points) exist in the bulk. The MC raps from the nexus of two such nodes, his words causing them to merge and gap out in a symmetric way. The **2Z** invariant in 3D is shown as chains of these nodes linking valence and conduction bands. The aesthetic is one of symmetric, gapless points held stable by symmetry.*

**Hook:** *"Time is real, charge is imaginary, a twisted blend / Chiral symmetry holds until the very end. Gapless nodes where the bulk bands cross / A **2Z** invariant, counting the loss."*

---

### **Overall SORA2 Cinematic Concept:**
The video could cycle through these ten classes like chapters in a grimoire, with a recurring motif of the **Bott Clock**—a giant, spectral clockface where the hour hand ticks through the symmetry classes (A, AIII, AI, BDI, D, DIII, AII, CII, C, CI) as the dimension increases. The rapper is the personification of the topological invariant itself, changing form with each class. The final shot pans out to reveal the entire periodic table, alive and humming, as a fundamental law of the quantum universe.
